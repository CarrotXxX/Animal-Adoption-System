# Animal Adoption System

Inspired by our love for animals, our team collaborated on a group project to develop an Animal Adoption System using JavaFX within an Agile framework.

Implemented functionality to add animals with details including name, description, and photos, with the capability to remove them from the system. Engaged in user testing and login scenarios throughout the Agile development process.
